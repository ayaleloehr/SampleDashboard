# SampleDashboard

### Instructions for creating a report for a new project
- To start a new status template, open "Project Status Template.md", click raw, and copy the contents of the entire file.  
- Get back to this page, then click "New File" and copy the text into the file, naming it whatever your project is named (make sure the file ends with .md).
- Commit the file to this folder. 

### Definitions in each report

- Yellow: Low/Moderate risk blockers require possible escalation / additional support
- Red: High risk blockers require escalation and immediate assistance.
- Blank: Activity not yet started
